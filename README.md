# Introduction

Welcome to the README file for the `readit` module, a Node.js package designed to generate high-quality READMEs for GitHub repositories using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. In this document, we will provide you with an overview of the `readit` package, its features, how to install and use it, and the high-level architecture of the package.

# Reasons to use readit

As a developer or a team of developers, creating a proper README file is essential to make your code available and understandable to others. In addition, an insightful README file is the first thing potential users and collaborators see when they visit your repository. The `readit` package provides an automated way of creating such README files with consistency and accuracy.

Using the `readit` package, you can generate a comprehensive README file using your project's source code. It automatically summarizes your project's source code and creates a detailed document that includes shields.io badges, installation instructions, usage examples, and more.

# How to Install readit

To run the `readit` package, you first need to install it in your project. You can do this using npm by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install @aramperes/readit
```

# How to Use readit

After installing the `readit` package, you can use it to generate a README file for your GitHub repository. Here is an example of how to use it:

```
const readit = require('@aramperes/readit');

const config = {
  rootPath: '/path/to/your/repo',
  gitUrl: 'https://github.com/yourName/yourRepository',
  language: 'node',
};

readit.createReadme(config);
```

The `createReadme` function takes in a configuration object that includes the following parameters:

- `rootPath`: The root path of your repository, where the `readit` package will analyze your source code files and generate README content.

- `gitUrl`: The URL of the GitHub repository where the code is hosted.

- `language`: The programming language used in your project. It is important to mention the `language` so `readit` can utilize the best vocabulary and syntax for the language.

After executing the `createReadme` function, the README file will be generated in your repository's root directory.

# High-level Architecture

The `readit` package uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate high-quality README files. It estimates the number of tokens for summarizing all the source code files, then splits them into chunks and generates prompts for summarization. Finally, the GPT-3 model completes the prompts and creates a full markdown README, seperating into multiple sections with relevant badges and a title.

The package includes the following files:

- `index.js`: Generates the README file for a GitHub project by reading source code files and creating prompts for GPT-3.

- `LICENSE`: A MIT License file that allows for modification, distribution, and selling of the software.

- `package.json`: A standard Node.js package file that lists the dependencies and metadata for the Node.js project.

# Conclusion

In summary, the `readit` package is an automated way of creating a high-quality README file for your GitHub repository. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate a thorough description of your project, including installation instructions, usage examples, and more. By using this package, you can save time and ensure that your README files are consistent and accurate. We hope you find this package useful for your future projects!
