## Introduction
In today's world, creating a clear and concise README file is an essential part of any software project's success. Users need to know what the project is about, what it does, how it works, and how to use it. However, creating a README file can be a tedious and time-consuming task, particularly for large projects. This is where the "readit" project comes in.

The "readit" project is a Node.js package that automates the creation of a GitHub-style README file for a given repository, compiling information from all files in the repo and generating a coherent and concise description of the project. Using OpenAI's GPT-3 API, "readit" generates a description for each file based on a prompt and combines the descriptions to form the final README. The README file generated by "readit" includes all necessary sections to convey the purpose and functionality of the project, along with sections on relevant shields.io badges.

## Installation
To install "readit," you will need Node.js and its package manager, npm, installed on your system. Once you have these, follow these steps:

1. Clone the "readit" repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/aramperes/readit.git`
2. Navigate to the "readit" directory: `cd readit`
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running: `npm install`

## High-level Architecture
"readit" consists of two main files:

* `index.js`: this file is the main program and contains the logic for generating a README file for a given repository using the OpenAI GPT-3 API.
* `LICENSE`: this file contains the licensing information for the software, letting users know about their permissions and responsibilities regarding using the software.
