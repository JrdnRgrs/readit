## Introduction
ReadIt is a Node.js script that automatically generates README files for Github repositories, summarizing the code using the OpenAI API. By using this package, developers can save time writing a README file from scratch, ensuring a consistent structure and decreasing the probability of missing important details. A well-written README file can help other developers use the code, learn how to contribute, and even encourage people to support the project.

## Installation
To use ReadIt, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aramperes/readit.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory, containing your OpenAI API Key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>
```
4. Run the script with the desired arguments:
```
node . <path to repo> <url of repo> <primary language>
```

Note that this package requires Node.js and an API key from the OpenAI API.

## High-level architecture
The script is executed by running `index.js`, which imports modules from `openai`, `./lib`, and `./lib/prompt.js`. It then reads the command line arguments, creates an instance of the OpenAI API, and defines the function `createReadme`, which performs the core functionality of generating a README for a repository.

Firstly, `createReadme` uses the `readSourceFiles` function from `./lib/source.js` to read the source code of a repository and returns a collection of `SourceBag` objects containing the code. Then, the function generates prompts using the `codeSummaryPrompt` and `readmePrompt` functions from `./lib/prompt.js`. The prompts are then used to generate summaries of the code using the OpenAI API.

Finally, `createReadme` generates the final README by combining the prompts and the response generated by the OpenAI API. It does this by first creating a default prompt and then appending prompts for each file in the repository. The response generated by the OpenAI API is then appended, resulting in the final README.
